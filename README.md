### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Gianluca Barbon, an Italian computer science professional with an R&D background. I hold a Ph.D. in applied formal methods for software verification, and I am now working as a full stack developer at Mia-Care, a [Mia-Platform](https://github.com/mia-platform) company.

I previously worked in academic research, in particular on:
- the debugging of concurrent and distributed applications, contributing to the [Clear](https://github.com/gbarbon/clear) tool;
- a degradation-aware privacy analysis of Android apps, contributing to the [DAPA](https://github.com/gbarbon/asa) static analyzer;
- the Arduino Service Interface Protocol (ASIP), contributing to the [Python ASIP Client](https://github.com/gbarbon/python-asip) for the [ASIP](https://github.com/michaelmargolis/asip) protocol.

I also worked in the industrial IoT field, as a software developer at [Eurotech](https://github.com/eurotech) and as a committer of [Kapua](https://github.com/eclipse/kapua), an [Eclipse Foundation](https://github.com/eclipse) IoT open-source project.
